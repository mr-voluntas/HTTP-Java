Main goals for this project..
    - learn how HTTP works under the hood
    - learn how libraries like express look behind the scenes
    - construct my own library which I can use to create restful HTTP APIs

What I currently know...
    - http is built upon TCP
    - http is a network protocol
        - being honest ive never though about it to much.. I just know its used for rest apis which return data in different formats, json & xml for example 
    - I have seem some example code on how libraries like express might be layed out
